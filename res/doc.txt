Flipped is a 2010 American romantic comedy-drama film co-written and directed by Rob Reiner,
and based on Wendelin Van Draanen's 2001 novel of the same name.
Set in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the film tells the story of two eighth graders,
Juli Baker and Bryce Loski, who develop contrasting feelings for each other as they navigate the challenges of adolescence.

The story unfolds from two distinct perspectives, each narrated by the respective protagonist.
Juli, an imaginative and passionate girl, immediately falls for Bryce upon his arrival in her neighborhood.
However, Bryce, initially awkward and self-conscious, misinterprets Juli's enthusiasm as annoyance and avoids her advances.

As the years pass, their paths continue to intertwine,
their contrasting personalities leading to a series of misunderstandings and mishaps.
Juli's unwavering admiration for Bryce remains steadfast, while Bryce gradually warms up to her,
recognizing her unique qualities and genuine kindness.

Amidst the backdrop of their blossoming relationship, Juli faces personal struggles,
including the loss of a beloved tree and the disapproval of her efforts to raise chickens.
Bryce, on the other hand, grapples with family tensions and the insecurities that stem from his father's critical nature.

The film concludes with Juli and Bryce finally acknowledging their mutual feelings,
having matured and gained a deeper understanding of each other.
They embark on a tentative romance, hinting at the promise of a lasting connection.
